Create a minimalist ebook cover in a clean and modern style for the title 'Começando do Zero: Construindo Interfaces com HTML e React'. The design should feature simple cartoon-style illustrations related to web development (such as a monitor, code snippets, or UI components). Use a harmonious color palette, clean lines, and plenty of negative space. The overall visual should feel approachable, beginner-friendly, and tech-oriented. Include the title prominently and ensure the style is lightweight, modern, and visually appealing.
